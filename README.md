# Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) Deployment Tools

The FIS Deployment Tools is a utility created to streamline the import of experiment templates in a standardized JSON format and their deployment into your AWS accounts. This tool simplifies the template import process, ensuring adherence to a common structure while providing customization options for specific environments.

The execution of these experiments should be carried out using alternative methods after they have been deployed. This can be accomplished through the console or command-line interface (CLI) for one-time runs or via a CI/CD pipeline as a part of your regular deployment testing process.

FIS deployment tools is currently available in the following languages: 
- CDK (NodeJS)
